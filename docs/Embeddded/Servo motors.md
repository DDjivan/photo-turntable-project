What do we need 
What should it do 
What exists already 
What are the different options 

# Servo Motor

## what is the weight targeted 
- a few grams 
- keep friction in mind, that's why we are going to use Ball bearings

### how to connect to the microcontroller 
- Hopefully with 3 cables, power, data and ground (VCC, PWM, GRD)
### what cables are need 
- 3 Jumper wires
### what power supply 
- The easiest is to just connect it to the 5V out pin of the microcontroller
### the speed of rotation 
- I don't think it really matters
- the faster the rotation, the faster the project
### how does it connect to the project 
- Servo -> Microcontroller -> PC
### what control do we have on it 
- we can decide which position the motor has
## how stable is it 
- i dont know (never turn the turntable by hand!!!!)

## how noisy is it
- i dont know (not that important)

spin 360° [?]

Issue: High voltage (8.4V) because of the 5 V of the arduino (we would need to use an external power supply)

we need a 360° Servo, which is not continious and around 5V
