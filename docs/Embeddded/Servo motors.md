# Servo Motor

## what is the weight targeted 
- a few grams 
- keep friction in mind, that's why we are going to use Ball bearings

### how to connect to the microcontroller 
- Hopefully with 3 cables, power, data and ground (VCC, PWM, GRD)
### what cables are need 
- 3 Jumper wires
### what power supply 
- The easiest is to just connect it to the 5V out pin of the microcontroller
### the speed of rotation 
- I don't think it really matters
- the faster the rotation, the faster the project
### how does it connect to the project 
- Servo -> Microcontroller -> PC
### what control do we have on it 
- we can decide which position the motor has
## how stable is it 
- i dont know (never turn the turntable by hand!!!!)

## how noisy is it
- i dont know (not that important)

Issue: High voltage (8.4V) because of the 5 V of the arduino (we would need to use an external power supply)

We decided not to use this one, because the shipping time would be too long and the price to high for our use case.

This one should be enough:

we need a 360° Servo, which is not continuous and around 5V and those should have all of those characteristics.

We decided to use some switches as emergency switches. So if some hair gets caught in the servo, we could turn it manually off. This are rectangular shaped switches so i hope its easier to design the hole in the CAD file. (It does not make that much sens, because when you print some thing with angles above maximal 45°, you need support material.  But they look nicer than the round ones.):

The ball bearings are an idea to let the turntable move better around and minimize the friction:

And to measure the dimensions of the Arduino, ball bearings and the servo we want to use a caliper:
