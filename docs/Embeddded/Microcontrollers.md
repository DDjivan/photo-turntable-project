### Arduino uno
We will probably use an Arduino uno or a 3rd party clone of the board, because I (Philip) have already some knowledge with the Arduino IDE and Arduino board, we got one of the boards supplied by the University, it is the most common of the boards and it probably meets our demands: It needs to drive the servo and we need to connect it to the backend of our project. We need to get the Arduino to talk with our desktop application (probably Godot).

In this video it's explained, how the Arduino can communicate with the Godot engine via serial port.

It would be cool to communicate via bluetooth (arduino to computer)
