# Road-map

## Sketch
Before making the next steps, we should have at least a sketch of how we want the table to look, how it should work in theory, and how the transfer between the phone and computer should be done.

## Basic prototype
Now the things become more practical, we should think of the features, the characteristics the product should have, like the maximum weight of the object, the size of the table, the stability of the table end structure problem

## Software and Communication
At this point starts the backend development, study and search for different softwares that we can use, see whats the best for us.
We need a mean to take photos with a phone, send the photos to a computer, which control the table, to make it rotate after it receive the photos, and in the end to create a model of the object.

## Construction and Assembling
The model now need to be made to be able to containt every hardware we need.



need to be resistent, durable, re-usable
